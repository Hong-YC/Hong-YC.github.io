Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage. I'm a Final Year Undergraduate Student in the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), pursing a bachelor degree in Data Science and Technology.

During my junior year, I have been working on research project under the supervision of [Professor Shueng-Han Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/) about video and image super-resolution ([my posts](https://hong-yc.github.io/blogs/superRes))

Currently, I am working on my Final Year Project about testing deeplearning libraries under the supervision of [Professor Shing-Chi Cheung](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~scc/) in HKUST.

In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, basketball and hiking.
